### Is it a bug?

GitHub Issues are for bugs only.

### Examples of things that aren’t considered bugs:

- Can’t figure out how to do something
- Having issues accessing your server
- Can’t get the server installed
- I want a new widget in my site
- If your issue falls into one of these categories, please see Getting Support

New feature requests should be posted in the right issue template named Suggestions.

## It is a bug!

### Before reporting a new issue

- Read the Documentation carefully all the way through.
- In case of using JungleWP Solutions, Make sure you are running the latest version. It’s very likely simply updating will resolve your issue.
- Try to narrow it down to reproducible steps. If we can reproduce it, we will be able to fix the issue a lot quicker.
- Look at all of your browser logs for errors.
- Search Google using a few different search terms.
- Search the Issues for your bug. If you find it carefully check that it is identical and give it a thumbs up, or add some additional information to the ticket if it differs. This will help give us a fuller picture.
- If you got this far then report an issue

### Reporting a new issue
- Giving clear background information will help save a lot of time.

Please include the following information in order to promote effective fixing.

- Operating System / Version / Architecture (64 bit?)

- Current solution version
